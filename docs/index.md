## Installation
The package is publicly available on PyPI.

We strongly encourage the use of a virtual environment:

```

## Running the example
An example implementation featuring the famous game of *tic-tac-toe* is available on the github repository under the branch with its name:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/corail-research/seahorse/ \
--branch tictactoe \
--single-branch tictactoe
```

## Main contributors
We are an enthusiastic team of M.Sc candidates led by Pr. Quentin Cappart at Polytechnique Montr√©al. The package was originally developed in the context of a introductory course to artificial intelligence given to undergrad computer and software engineering students.
