#1 - Getting started
One simple way to check if seahorse was correctly installed is to do the following command line:

```shell
python main_tictac.py -t local -g 1 random_player_tictac.py alpha_player_tictac.py   
```
A graphic interface should then appear in your browser.

|Initial state|Intermediate state|Final state|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|

seahorse has a multi-level log system which enables users to easily tack information.
